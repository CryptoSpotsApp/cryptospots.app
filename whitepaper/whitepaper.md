Cryptospot Token is a TRC10 token launched on the TRON blockchain that will deploy smart contract technology to power a decentralized application. SPOT will be used to incentivize users of the DApp, unlock events, cast votes, store value, or purchase goods and services.

# PRE-RAMBLE
Did Satoshi imagine that there would be trillions of absolutely worthless or dead coins and tokens? Have we betrayed his vision by continually chasing worthless assets? Crypto is infiltrating nearly every aspect of our lives, yet 95% of the world doesn’t even know what “it” is or how to use it. New assets are created out of thin air yet most of them will never find a use-case.
Where can we use these assets? Who can we trust in this trustless crypto-space? Which project will exit-scam and disappear with “pre-sale BTC” and leave its’ community with another worthless digital asset?
In a constantly evolving market of avatars and repositories, it can be difficult to decide who can be trusted or where assets are accepted.

#ABSTRACT
The crypto-community NEEDS a trustworthy resource that provides information on not only where to spend digital assets, but also the overall trust rating and availability of these merchants. As the industry grows,
weaker projects will die out and the stronger projects will become more deeply ingrained into societal use with widespread acceptance and eventual mass adoption.
The elephant in the room - is a lack of information about where to use cryptocurrency and how to use it. There is a
growing demand for resources that can facilitate crypto transactions as we see more and more IOT projects,
interactive API’s, and even debit card integration. Users need information and a means to utilize their crypto assets in every-day situations.
But why would someone spend their hard-earned assets?
……. INCENTIVIZATION

#INTRODUCTION
Cryptospot token (SPOT) has a vision to connect users with merchants around the globe in both online and physical
retail markets. We want to bridge the infinite gap that is the question: “Where can I spend these crypto assets?”
In the palm of your hand you hold the most powerful device known to man. No need to guess, IT’S YOUR
SMARTPHONE, pervert! With blockchain technology and
IOT quickly developing and changing our lives, it would be great to know where and how you can use these digital assets. We are here to offer you a simple solution.
Partnering with retailers all over the world, we will link users to merchants in a way that will reward both parties.
The user can locate retailers both online and cartographically using a simple mobile application. The
merchant can advertise their products and inform the user which assets are accepted and what services and goods can be acquired.

#EXPLANATION
We are creating a mobile DApp that features an interactive map of businesses that accept cryptocurrency as payment. Users of the app will see the locations of the businesses, the type of business, the currencies they accept, the reputation of the retailer, and links to their website.
In another section of the app there will be a comprehensive list of online retailers that accept digital assets. This will be a separate tab that does not interact with the map.
Retailers and vendors will benefit from using this app as they will be rewarded with SPOT Tokens. These tokens can be traded on exchanges and used at participating locations or websites.
The DApp will have interactive sorting methods and search criteria, as well as a reward system integrated directly into the app.

# DAPP INTERACTION

## THE DAPP
So how does a mobile app become a dapp?
Well who controls the money at banks? – a central authority
A DApp has NO central authority other than the blockchain protocol and its limits. Community
governance, ratified by consensus keeps the chain
moving as transactions and events occur. Therefore a
true DApp must maintain consistency that is perpetuated by its users and their commitment to upholding the purpose of the decentralized app within the protocol of the blockchain.
Even though Cryptospots.app will require monitoring and guidance from the organization, its daily operation and growth will rely solely on the users.

Users will participate in verification by the following methods:
- Proof of Location (PoL)
- Proof of Quality (PoQ)
- Proof of Participation (PoP)
- Proof of Delivery (PoD)

Transaction sizes will designate the type of proof executed on the blockchain. For example purposes:
- “Hometown Grocery” lists their business on Cryptospots = PoP
- John Doe creates an account = PoP
- John Doe uses location settings to “check in” at Hometown Grocery while shopping = PoL
- John Doe shops at a “cryptospot” online and confirms receipt goods or services = PoD
- John Doe rates a business “5 stars” = PoQ

Limits and auditing will be generically enforced to prevent abuse. Minimum and maximum order thresholds will also be implemented to prevent misuse.

# THE TRON BLOCKCHAIN
“TRON allows users to create their own contracts of any complexity they wish. Smart contract[s] will run on
virtual machine. In this way, TRON serves as a platform for developers to create many different types of applications that actualize complex scenes.”
Tron Virtual Machine (TVM) utilizes the “google protobuf” protocol which allows decentralized apps to be seamlessly created with smart contract deployment directly on the TRX blockchain.
Contracts / assets can be viewed at https://Tronscan.org
The Tron (TRX) consensus mechanism uses delegated proof of stake (DPoS) which allows the community to
vote for super representatives that will receive the block rewards. Votes are held every four hours.

Changes can (and will) be made without prior notice or consent, but the community will be notified of any and all changes.
Reward structure and smart contract deployment are experimental in nature, and results may vary.
It is our goal to integrate TRON into a unique ecosystem that can benefit its users by simplicity and interoperability.

Cryptospot (SPOT) is a TRC10 Token intended to reward users and facilitate community participation.

This project is the vision of the crypto kid known as “Cretinous”
He endeavors to remain transparent (although not with his identity - even though it could easily be found).

This is a community project that requires community input and participation.

The views and opinions of the users of this service do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of Cretinous, nor do the views and opinions of Cretinous necessarily reflect the views and opinions of this platform’s users.

Crypto is made to be accessible and fun for *everyone*.
